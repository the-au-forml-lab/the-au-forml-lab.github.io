CCS Colloquium
--------------
-------------------

#### Description

This is the schedule for the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences
(CCS) Colloquium Series.  This course brings weekly researchers in CCS
related areas to Augusta University to introduce their work, and
provide an opportunity for networking.

This semester the seminar is completely online, and thus, we will be
opening the talks up to the wider research community.

This page will be updated with the details of each talk including
their abstracts.

#### Format

Each talk will be over Zoom.  If you are interested in attending one
of the presentations please RSVP a few days in advance by sending
Harley Eades an <a href="mailto:harley.eades@gmail.com">email</a>.

#### Videos

All of the talks are recorded and posted on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3G8P4NMeIdj1roMoCEi0Q/videos)
