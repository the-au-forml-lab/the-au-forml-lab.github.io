#### Abstract

Many programming languages include a "type system" as a form of
lightweight program verification which can eliminate bugs and aid
programmer understanding. Traditionally such type systems characterise
and categorise the data involved in a program, but many new type
systems are being developed which capture program behaviour. Such
"behavioural type systems" can futher guide the programmer, aiding
them in avoiding bugs, and even more excitingly providing a
specification from which a program can be algorithmically generated,
at least in part. In this talk, I will explain and demonstrate a
particular class of such behavioural types systems based on the recent
idea of "graded types".  I'll demo this technique in a practical
setting, showing how we can constrain program behaviour via complex
specifications, and sometimes even have parts of a program generated
for us.

This talk will be pitched at undergraduate/postgraduate level and will
include various programming examples in more than one language
(spoiler: I will start with some assembly code!)
