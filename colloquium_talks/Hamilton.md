#### Abstract

One of the most important properties we would like to know about
programs is their resource usage, i.e., the amount of resources (such
as time, memory, etc.)  required for their execution. However, it is
undecidable whether or not a variable's value in a Turing-complete
language is polynomially bounded, let alone determining what those
polynomial bounds are. It has previously been shown by Ben-Amram,
Jones and Kristiansen, for a slightly weaker language that is not
Turing-complete, that it is possible to decide whether or not a
variable's value is polynomially bounded. However, finding these
polynomial bounds is a difficult problem: the polynomial-bound
analysis problem. In this talk, we show how to solve the
polynomial-bound analysis problem by finding tight symbolic bounds (up
to constant factors) on the polynomially bounded variables of a
program in the language of Ben-Amram, Jones and Kristiansen.
