#### Abstract

In developing applications for data-intensive computations, there has
typically been a tradeoff between programmability and performance,
with frameworks like MapReduce preferring programmability over
performance. Our work has been demonstrating that high-level APIs can
be supported without compromising performance. Specifically, we
introduced a variant of MapReduce based on the idea of reduction
object. This talk will describe three different systems we have
developed using this API (and its extensions). The first system
focused on in-situ analytics for scientific simulations. Our system,
Smart, is able to provide a high-level API for developing such
applications. This system results in much higher performance compared
to systems like Spark, and almost comparable performance to use of
MPI.  The second system is for processing streaming data in a
fault-tolerant fashion. Finally, the last system considers an IoT
environment where data is processed using a combination of edge
devices and a centralized system. We focus on a set of Computer Vision
applications for this environment. By generalization of our
reduction-based API, we show how a pattern based framework can achieve
programmability and performance, and even facilitate optimizations not
normally feasible.

#### Bio

Gagan Agrawal is a Professor in School of Computer and Cyber Sciences
at Augusta University.  Agrawal received his undergraduate degree from
Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 1991 and MS and PhD degrees
from University of Maryland, College Park, in 1994 and 1996. He served
as assistant professor at University of Delaware from 1996 to 2001,
and Associate and Full Professor at Ohio State between 2001 and 2019.
Agrawalâ€™s research interests include high performance computing
(with emphasis on programming and application frameworks, performance
modeling and resilience), parallel machine learning and data mining,
cloud and edge computing, and scientific data management. He has
published more than 275 papers in these areas over his career and has
supervised 30 PhD dissertations. Several of his works have received
best paper awards or best paper finalist nominations, including from
conferences like SC, HPDC, ICS, CCGRID and HiPC. His work has been
extensively funded by National Science Foundation and Department of
Energy. He has served on editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on
Parallel and Distributed Computing, IEEE Transactions on Cloud
Computing, and Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing. He also
served on the ACM Dissertation Award Committee, including chairing it
for one year. He has also served as a program committee member, area
chair or program co-chair for several conferences in his research
areas.
