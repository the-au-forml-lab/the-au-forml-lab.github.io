#### Abstract

An important problem in quantum computing is the so-called approximate
synthesis problem: to find a quantum circuit, preferably as short as
possible, that approximates a given target operation up to given
epsilon. For nearly two decades, from 1995 to 2012, the standard
solution to this problem was the so-called Solovay-Kitaev algorithm,
which is based on geometric ideas. This algorithm produces circuits of
size $$O(\mathsf{log}^c(1/\epsilon))$$, where $$c$$ is a constant
approximately equal to $$3.97$$. It was a long-standing open problem
whether the exponent c could be reduced to 1. In this talk, I will
answer this question positively, and report on a new class of
efficient algorithms for solving the approximate synthesis
problem. These algorithms are based on number theory, and are
intimatedly related to classical results in number theory, such as
which primes can be written as a sum of two squares.  This is joint
work with Neil J. Ross. No knowledge of quantum computing or number
theory will be assumed.

# Bio

Peter Selinger is a professor of mathematics at Dalhousie
University in Halifax, Canada. He obtained his Ph.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania in the 1990s under the supervision of Andre
Scedrov. His main interest is the semantics of programming languages,
and his particular niche is programming languages for quantum
computing.
