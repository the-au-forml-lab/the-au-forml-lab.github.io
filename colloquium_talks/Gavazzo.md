#### Abstract

Coeffects and their associated type systems (such as graded modal
types, quantitative types, and generalised bounded linear types) are
becoming a standard programming language formalism to deal with
context-dependent computations where code usage plays a central
role. The theory of program equivalence for coeffectful languages,
however, is considerably underdeveloped if compared to the
denotational and operational semantics of such languages. This raises
the question of how much of the theory of ordinary program equivalence
can be given in a coeffectful scenario. In this talk, I will give an
introduction to coinductive equivalences for higher-order programming
languages with graded modal types modelling coeffectful behaviours. In
particular, I will show how Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity can be
extended to deal with coeffectful behaviours. To maintain the talk as
accessible as possible, I will not assume any previous knowledge on
(coinductively-defined) notions of program equivalence, which I will
gently introduce in the very first part of the seminar.
