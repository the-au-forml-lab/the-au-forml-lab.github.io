#### Abstract

Information technology usage has been widely studied under many
different names causing confusion and limiting knowledge accumulation
on a construct that has been called “central” to the information
systems discipline. This research clarifies the various IT use
constructs in the literature through a systematic analysis of the
theories, measures, and antecedents of IT use. Two archetypes of IT
use are identified in the literature: “continued use” based on
efficiency and “novel use” based on innovation. We then conduct a
Q-sort to identify potential measures of these types of IT use. A
theory of IT use with antecedents based on organizational structures
and individual user perceptions is developed. The theory is tested
using a survey of 386 people who use IT in their workplaces. Findings
indicate organizational antecedents may be used by managers to
influence employees toward efficient or innovative IT use as needed.
