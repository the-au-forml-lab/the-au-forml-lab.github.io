#### Abstract

I will talk about a system that combines Dependent Types and Linear
Types. As an application of this system, I will show how to transport
Martin Hofmann's LFPL and Amortised Resource analysis systems for
linear and polynomial time computation to full dependent types. This
results in a system where unconstrained computations are permitted at
the type level, but only polynominal time computations are permitted
at the term level. The combined system now allows one to explore the
world of propositions whose proofs are not only constructive, but also
of restricted complexity.

#### Bio

Bob Atkey is a Chancellor's Fellow and Lecturer at the University of
Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Before this position, he did a PhD
and postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, and worked for a spin-out
company on static analysis of concurrent Java programs.
