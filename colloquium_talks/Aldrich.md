#### Abstract

Programming language design research has traditionally focused
primarily on theoretical properties and performance considerations.
But programming languages are interfaces that programmers use to write
programs.  Recent work has begun to explore how to integrate
interdisciplinary methods, including qualitative and quantitative user
studies, into the language design process.  I'll describe how we
applied such methods in two different designs, Obsidian and Glacier,
some of the insights we gained, and discuss the larger impact these
emerging methods can have on the field.
