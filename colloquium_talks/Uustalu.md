#### Abstract

Skew monoidal categories of Szlachányi are like monoidal categories
except that the structural laws of unitality and associativity are
only required to be natural transformations in a certain
direction. One can similarly talk of skew variants of monoidal closed
categories, closed categories (without the tensor but with the unit),
prounital-closed categories (with just a "shadow" of the unit in a
non-represented form), and also of partially normal skew X categories
where partial normality means that some of the structural laws are
required to be invertible. All of these arise naturally in various
categorical contexts and also in computer science, in semantical
applications, in particular around various constructions with monads
and comonads.

Coherence for this type of categories with structure is not like Mac
Lane's for monoidal categories: it is far from trivial to analyze
the homsets of the free skew monoidal category or, more generally, the
free skew X category, over a set or a (multi)graph and interesting
phenomena occur.

In this talk, I will explain how this problem can be approached with
methods of structural proof theory. The idea is to identify a map of
the free skew X category with an equivalence class of derivations in a
suitable sequent calculus. Applying the technique of focusing, one
then seeks to define a canonical representative for each equivalence
class.

This is joint work with Niccolò Veltri (Tallinn University of
Technology) and Noam Zeilberger (École Polytechnique).
