#### Abstract

Bisimilarity as an equivalence notion of systems has been central to
process theory. Due to the recent rise of interest in quantitative
systems (probabilistic, weighted, hybrid, etc.), bisimilarity has been
extended in various ways: notably, bisimulation metric between
probabilistic systems. An important feature of bisimilarity is its
game-theoretic characterization, where Spoiler and Duplicator play
against each other; extension of bisimilarity games to quantitative
settings has been actively pursued too. In this talk, we present a
general framework that uniformly describes game characterizations of
bisimilarity-like notions. Our framework is formalized categorically
using fibrations and coalgebras. In particular, our characterization
of bisimilarity in terms of fibrational predicate transformers allows
us to derive codensity bisimilarity games: a general categorical game
characterization of bisimilarity.

This is a joint work with Yuichi Komorida, Nick Hu, Bartek Klin and
Ichiro Hasuo.
