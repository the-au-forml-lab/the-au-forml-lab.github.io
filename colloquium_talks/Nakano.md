#### Abstract

A Turing machine is a computational model that can represent all
computable functions. By imposing syntactic restrictions on the Turing
machine, it is possible to construct a computational model that
defines only computable functions satisfying a certain property
P. However, it is not obvious whether the restricted computational
model covers all computable functions satisfying the property P.  In
this talk, I will introduce computational models corresponding to the
three properties of functions: injectivity, involutoriness, and
idempotence. Although all of these properties are undecidable, the
corresponding computational models are given as Turing machines with
decidable syntactic restrictions.
