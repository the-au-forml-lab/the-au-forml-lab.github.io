#### Abstract

The past decade has seen the advent of several large-scale digital
libraries of formalised mathematics, written with the help of proof
assistants. Most of these libraries are framed by hierarchies of
formal algebraic structures. These structures play a similar role as
Bourbaki's mathematical structures, codifying the mathematical
language used throughout the library, its vocabulary and its
notational apparatus. The latter hierarchies can also be seen as a
formal-proof-engineering device, which organises inheritance and
sharing between various interfaces.

This talk will discuss the recent techniques proposed to design these
hierarchies in proof assistants based on dependent type theory, the
corresponding achievements, but also their pitfalls and limitations.
