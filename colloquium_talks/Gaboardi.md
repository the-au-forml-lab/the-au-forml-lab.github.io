#### Abstract

Symbolic execution is a classic technique used for testing, counterexample generation and to prove
absence of bugs. Here we will present an extension of symbolic execution to support these tasks
specifically for probabilistic relational properties, that is properties expressed in terms of two
runs of a probabilistic program. Our technique leverages two ideas: relational reasoning and
probabilistic coupling. These ideas have been used for formal verification using program logics and
type systems. We show here how they can also be smoothly integrated with symbolic execution in order
to support verification and finding  violations to probabilistic relational properties. To guide
our development and presentation, we will focus on differential privacy, an important example of
probabilistic relational property which has been studied extensively in recent work.

The talk will be based on joint work with Gian Pietro Farina (as part of his PhD at the University
at Buffalo, SUNY) and Stephen Chong (Harvard University).
