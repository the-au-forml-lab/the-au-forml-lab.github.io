#### Abstract

Programmers are rapidly adopting expressive, dynamically typed,
higher-order functional programming languages for their everyday
development tasks. Over time, these programs are often fortified with
static type checking by migrating programs using gradual types, a
technique now widely used by the largest industrial software
development companies. Unfortunately, there are limits both to what
properties gradual types can validate and the help they can provide
programs as they engage in the migration process. In parallel,
researchers have developed sophisticated next generation programming
languages with integrated verification features. These languages are
able to validate much stronger claims about the correctness of
software, but their industrial adoption has lagged far behind gradual
typing. Consequently, verification is not being integrated in the
everyday lives of programmers and the quality and reliability of
software suffers because of it. This represents a tremendous missed
opportunity considering the rapid advancement of automated
verification techniques.

In this talk, I will give an overview of my group's recent efforts to
close the expressivity gap between commonplace scripting languages and
rarefied verification-integrated languages, enabling pathways to
verified programming at every point along the spectrum from scripting
languages to theorem proving languages.

#### Author Bio

David Van Horn is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer
Science and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) at
the University of Maryland, College Park. His research interests are
in programming languages and formal methods, where he works toward
making the construction of reusable, trusted software components
possible and effective. He publishes regularly in the flagship SIGPLAN
conferences, POPL, PLDI, OOPSLA, and ICFP, and his work has been
recognized with a NSF CAREER Award, a CRA Computing Innovation
Fellowship, a Communications of the ACM Research Highlight, an OOPSLA
Distinguished Paper Award, and an ICFP Most Influential Paper Award.
He is the co-author of “Realm of Racket,” an illustrated book on
programming video games, written and illustrated with eight
undergraduate students. He is committed to broadening participation in
computer science and is currently serving on the Steering Committee of
the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop and the
faculty mentor for Technica, the world's largest all-women and
non-binary hackathon.
