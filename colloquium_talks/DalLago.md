#### Abstract

Type-two constructions abound in cryptography: adversaries for
encryption and authentication schemes, if active, are modeled as
algorithms having access to oracles, i.e. as second-order
algorithms. But how about making cryptographic schemes themselves
higher-order? This paper gives an answer to this question, by first
describing why higher-order cryptography is interesting as an object
of study, then showing how the concept of probabilistic polynomial
time algorithm can be generalized so as to encompass algorithms of
order strictly higher than two, and finally proving some positive and
negative results about the existence of higher-order cryptographic
primitives, namely authentication schemes and pseudorandom
functions. This is a joint work with Boaz Barak and Raphaëlle
Crubillé.
