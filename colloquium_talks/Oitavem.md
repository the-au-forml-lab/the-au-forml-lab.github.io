#### Abstract

P, NP, and Pspace are well-known classes of computational complexity
that can be described following different approaches. Here we describe
them in a machine independent manner, using recursion schemes, which
turn the known inclusions P ⊆ NP ⊆ Pspace obvious.  Our strategy is,
as always in recursion-theoretic contexts, to start with a set of
initial functions — which should be basic from the complexity point of
view — and to close it under composition and recursion schemes. The
recursion schemes can be bounded or unbounded depending on the chosen
approach. In the first case we consider Cobham’s characterization of
P, in the second case we consider the Bellantoni-Cook characterization
of P.  Pspace is characterized using a scheme of recursion with
pointers. The scheme of recursion with pointers of Pspace can be
restricted, leading to char- acterizations of known complexity classes
like NP, PP, #P, and other counting classes. In this talk we focus on
P, NP, and Pspace.
