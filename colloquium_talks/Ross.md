#### Abstract
 I explain how we methodologically uncovered privacy vulnerabilities in the ICAO 9303 standard implemented by ePassports worldwide. These vulnerabilities, confirmed by ICAO, the UN agency responsible for ePassport standards, enable an ePassport holder who recently passed through a checkpoint to be reidentified without opening their ePassport. I explain how bisimilarity was used to discover these vulnerabilities, which exploit the BAC protocol - the original ICAO 9303 standard ePassport authentication protocol - and remains valid for the PACE protocol, which improves on the security of BAC in the latest ICAO 9303 standards.
