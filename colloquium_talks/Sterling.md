#### Abstract

This is joint work with Robert Harper.

How do you prove that two implementations of an abstract type behave
the same in all configurations? Reynolds famously employed logical
relations to establish such results; roughly, a logical relation is a
structure-respecting relation between two interpretations of a theory
that evinces, in the base case, a desirable invariant.

We present a synthetic way to understand and interact with logical
relations, related to classical logical relations in the same way that
Euclidean geometry relates to point-sets. Previously a logical
relation was defined in terms of the (complicated) details of how it
is constructed as a certain kind of relation over syntax. We instead
take the simpler view that everything in sight is a logical relation,
and then use modalities to isolate those logical relations that are
degenerate in either the syntactic or the semantic direction.

Our “logical relations as types” principle has led to a new account of
modules and representation independence (S., Harper), as well as the
first proofs of normalization for cubical type theory (S., Angiuli)
and general multi-modal dependent type theory (Gratzer).
