#### Abstract

Homotopy Type Theory allows us to reason about the homotopy theory of
spaces in a type-theoretic language. Unfortunately, not all
mathematical problems can be reduced to homotopy theory, so we would
like to extend HoTT with tools that let us discuss extra structure
that is present in particular models. The first example of this was
Shulman's Cohesive HoTT, where a couple of new unary type formers let
us talk about "discrete" and "codiscrete" spaces, enabling a type
theoretic proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. In this talk I will
demonstrate an extension in a different direction: adding linear
tensors and homs, with the aim of giving us a convenient way to
manipulate "spectra", the central objects of stable homotopy theory.

This is joint work with Dan Licata.
