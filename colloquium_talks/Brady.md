#### Abstract

Idris is a functional programming language with first-class types, where
types may be parameterised by other values. This allows us to give
increasingly precise specifications for functions, and be more confident
in their correctness. But, perhaps more importantly, it gives the
language implementation more information up front about what a function
should do. Therefore, we can use Idris as an interactive assistant, and
treat programming as a conversation with the machine.

In particular, the Idris system supports program synthesis, generating
(fragments of) programs from types. In this talk, I will show the
current state of program synthesis in Idris, outline how it works, and
discuss some possible future research directions.

#### Bio

Dr. Edwin Brady is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of
St Andrews, interested in type theory, dependently typed functional
programming, compilers and metaprogramming. He is currently working on
a new implementation of Idris, a dependently typed functional
programming language. When He is not doing that, you might find him
playing Go (He is about 2 kyu), walking up a hill, watching a game of
cricket, or waiting for a delayed train.
