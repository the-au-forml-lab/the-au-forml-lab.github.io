#### Abstract

In this talk I seek to achieve two things. First, I aim to give a very
concise introduction to modern applied proof theory, without assuming
any prior knowledge of this area. Second, I will present some new
research of mine in Tauberian theory, including a proof theoretic
study of the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem.
