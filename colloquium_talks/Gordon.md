#### Abstract

Based on joint work with Simon Peyton Jones, Jack Williams, and many others.

The Calc Intelligence project at Microsoft Research Cambridge has a
long-standing partnership with the Excel team to transform spreadsheet
formulas into a full-fledged programming language. At POPL 2019, we
announced data types (which allow cells to contain first-class
records) and dynamic arrays (which allow a formula in a cell to
compute a whole array that spills into adjacent cells). In a blog post
in December 2020 and a sponsored talk at POPL 2021, we announced
LAMBDA, which makes Excel’s formulas Turing-complete. The purpose of
this talk is to get you excited about the programming possibilities
opened up by LAMBDA in Excel – the world’s most widely used
programming language – and to outline some research challenges.
