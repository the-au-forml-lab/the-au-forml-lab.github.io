#### Abstract

The last few decades have seen tremendous strides in various
technologies for reasoning about programs. However, we believe these
technologies will only become ubiquitous if they can be seamlessly
integrated within programming languages with mature compilers,
libraries and tools, so that programmers can use them continuously
throughout the software development life cycle (and not just as a
means of post-facto validation.)

In this talk, we will describe how refinement types offer a path
towards integrating verification into existing host languages. We show
how refinements allow the programmer to extend specifications using
types, to extend the analysis using SMT, and finally, to extend
verification beyond automatically decidable logical fragments, by
allowing programmers to interactively write proofs simply as functions
in the host language.

Finally, we will describe some of the lessons learned while building
and using the language integrated verifier LiquidHaskell. We will
describe some problems that are considered hard in theory, but which
turn out to be easy to address in practice, and we will describe other
problems which might appear easy, but are actually giant roadblocks
that will have to be removed to make verification broadly used.

#### Author Bio

Ranjit Jhala is a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the
University of California, San Diego. He works on algorithms and tools
that help engineer reliable computer systems.  His work draws from and
contributes to the areas of Model Checking, Program Analysis, and
Automated Deduction, and Type Systems.  He is fortunate to have helped
create several influential systems including the BLAST software model
checker, RELAY race detector, MACE/ MC distributed language and model
checker, and Liquid Types.  He was awarded ACM SIGPLAN's Robin Milner
Young Researcher Award in 2018.
