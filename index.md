The ForML (**For**mal **M**ethods and Computational **L**ogic) Lab in
the [School of Computer and Cyber
Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) at [Augusta
University](https://www.augusta.edu/) strives to advance the software
development process by utilizing the principles and techniques from
logic, mathematics, and interactive/automated theorem proving to
ensure the correctness of software.

The primary research areas of the faculty and students in the ForML
lab are: foundations of programming languages, interactive theorem
proving, categorical logic, reversible computing, and secure
programming.
